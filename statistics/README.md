Of course. Here is the updated `README.md` that includes the latest analysis features for identifying hourly patterns and the slowest specific time intervals.

# üìä Internet Speed Test Analyzer

A Python script to analyze and visualize internet speed test data from a CSV file. It identifies the slowest connection intervals, summarizes performance by hour of day, and generates detailed plots.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```
2.  **Place your data file** (`speedtest-log.csv`) in the same directory as the script.

-----

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script from your terminal.

  * **To save the plots as PNG files**:
    ```bash
    python analyze_speedtest.py
    ```
  * **To display interactive plot windows**:
    ```bash
    python analyze_speedtest.py --output show
    ```
  * **To specify a different CSV file**:
    ```bash
    python analyze_speedtest.py --file "path/to/your/data.csv"
    ```

## üìã Example Output

### Console

The script prints several summaries to your terminal: a "Top 10" list of the slowest intervals, an hourly performance breakdown, and overall statistics.

### Generated Files (`--output save`)

The script will generate three image files:

1.  **`internet_performance_over_time.png`**: A line graph showing your ping, download, and upload measurements over the entire time period.
2.  **`internet_speed_distributions.png`**: A set of three histograms showing the frequency of different values for your ping, download, and upload speeds.
3.  **`hourly_performance.png`**: A bar chart showing the average internet speed and latency for each hour of the day, helping you to easily spot daily patterns.
